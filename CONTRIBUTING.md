## Making Changes

### Before You Start
- Create an issue first (unless it's a small fix)
- Discuss your approach with maintainers
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### Development Guidelines

1. **Keep it simple**: This extension aims to be lightweight and focused
2. **Maintain compatibility**: Support both Chrome and Edge
3. **Security first**: Always sanitize user input and data
4. **Test thoroughly**: Test with various websites and edge cases

### Key Areas

- **background.js**: Service worker, context menus, webhook sending
- **popup.js**: Main UI logic, status display, payload preview
- **options.js**: Configuration management, webhook testing
- **manifest.json**: Extension permissions and configuration

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Load the extension** in developer mode
2. **Test basic functionality**:
   - Click extension icon on various websites
   - Test context menu on selected text
   - Verify payload is sent correctly to Home Assistant
3. **Test edge cases**:
   - Special characters in URLs/titles
   - Very long URLs or selected text
   - Pages with unusual content
4. **Security testing**:

All changes undergo security review, especially those affecting:
- Data handling and transmission
- User input processing
- Permission usage
- External network requests
